At Chrome Dev Conf, Paul Irish asked me what I was working on. As I rambled about 
the things I was doing, I was struck that it was even tedious for me to be having
the conversation. WHAT WAS I DOING?!?!

So I set out to do something fun that I would enjoy talking about.

Hello, Music Routes Playlist Generator.

In honor of it being inspired by a Google employee at a Google event at Google, I
used a bunch of Google services:

* Freebase API
* Polymer Paper elements to implement Material Design
* Google Analytics

Other important elemtns:

* Browserify
* Lab and Code (from the HapiJS project) for testing
